**Recognizing a road sign with kNN**

After several trips with a human behind the wheel, it is time for the self-driving car to attempt the test course alone.

As it begins to drive away, its camera captures the following image:

![](_images/knn_stop_99.gif)

Can you apply a kNN classifier to help the car recognize this sign?

The dataset `signs` is loaded in your workspace along with the dataframe `next_sign`, which holds the observation you want to classify.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

#prepare dataset for use (why oh why don't you do this DataCamp?)
signs <- read.csv("_data/knn_traffic_signs.csv")
next_sign <- signs %>% filter(r1 == 204 & b1 == 220) %>% select(-id, -sample, -sign_type)
signs <- signs %>% filter(sample == "train") %>% select(-id, -sample)

# Load the 'class' package
library(class)

# Create a vector of labels
sign_types <- signs$sign_type

# Classify the next sign observed
knn(train = signs[-1], test = next_sign, cl = sign_types)
```

Awesome! You've trained your first nearest neighbor classifier!

kNN isn't really learning anything; it simply looks for the most similar example.

**Exploring the traffic sign dataset**

To better understand how the `knn()` function was able to classify the stop sign, it may help to examine the training dataset it used.

Each previously observed street sign was divided into a 4x4 grid, and the red, green, and blue level for each of the 16 center pixels is recorded as illustrated here.

![](_images/1004.png)

The result is a dataset that records the `sign_type` as well as 16 x 3 = 48 color properties of each sign.

```{r}
# Examine the structure of the signs dataset
str(signs)

# Count the number of signs of each type
table(signs$sign_type)

# Check r10's average red level by sign type
aggregate(r10 ~ sign_type, data = signs, mean)
```

Great work! As you might have expected, stop signs tend to have a higher average red value. This is how kNN identifies similar signs.

**Classifying a collection of road signs**

Now that the autonomous vehicle has successfully stopped on its own, your team feels confident allowing the car to continue the test course.

The test course includes 59 additional road signs divided into three types:

![](_images/knn_stop_28.gif) 
![](_images/knn_speed_55.gif)
![](_images/knn_peds_47.gif)

At the conclusion of the trial, you are asked to measure the car's overall performance at recognizing these signs.

The `class` package and the dataset `signs` are already loaded in your workspace. So is the dataframe `test_signs`, which holds a set of observations you'll test your model on.

```{r}
test_signs <- read.csv("_data/knn_traffic_signs.csv")
test_signs <- test_signs %>% filter(sample == "test") %>% select(-id, -sample)

# Use kNN to identify the test road signs
sign_types <- signs$sign_type
signs_pred <- knn(train = signs[-1], test = test_signs[-1], cl = sign_types)

# Create a confusion matrix of the predicted versus actual values
signs_actual <- test_signs$sign_type
table(signs_pred, signs_actual)

# Compute the accuracy
mean(signs_pred == signs_actual)
```

Fantastic! That self-driving car is really coming along! The confusion matrix lets you look for patterns in the classifier's errors.

## What about the 'k' in kNN?

![](_images/1005.png)

![](_images/1006.png)

With smaller neighborhoods, kNN can identify more subtle patterns in the data.

**Testing other 'k' values**

By default, the `knn()` function in the `class` package uses only the single nearest neighbor.

Setting a `k` parameter allows the algorithm to consider additional nearby neighbors. This enlarges the collection of neighbors which will vote on the predicted class.

Compare `k` values of 1, 7, and 15 to examine the impact on traffic sign classification accuracy.

The `class` package is already loaded in your workspace along with the datasets `signs`, `signs_test`, and `sign_types`. The object `signs_actual` holds the true values of the signs.

```{r}
signs_test <- test_signs

# Compute the accuracy of the baseline model (default k = 1)
k_1 <- knn(train = signs[-1], test = signs_test[-1], cl = sign_types)
mean(signs_actual == k_1)

# Modify the above to set k = 7
k_7 <- knn(train = signs[-1], test = signs_test[-1], cl = sign_types, k = 7)
mean(signs_actual == k_7)

# Set k = 15 and compare to the above
k_15 <- knn(train = signs[-1], test = signs_test[-1], cl = sign_types, k = 15)
mean(signs_actual == k_15)
```

You're a kNN pro! Which value of k gave the highest accuracy?

**Seeing how the neighbors voted**

When multiple nearest neighbors hold a vote, it can sometimes be useful to examine whether the voters were unanimous or widely separated.

For example, knowing more about the voters' confidence in the classification could allow an autonomous vehicle to use caution in the case there is *any chance at all* that a stop sign is ahead.

In this exercise, you will learn how to obtain the voting results from the `knn()` function.

The `class` package has already been loaded in your workspace along with the datasets `signs`, `sign_types`, and `signs_test`.

```{r}
# Use the prob parameter to get the proportion of votes for the winning class
sign_pred <- knn(train = signs[-1], test = signs_test[-1], cl = sign_types, k = 7, prob = TRUE)

# Get the "prob" attribute from the predicted classes
sign_prob <- attr(sign_pred, "prob")

# Examine the first several predictions
head(sign_pred)

# Examine the proportion of votes for the winning class
head(sign_prob)
```

Wow! Awesome job! Now you can get an idea of how certain your kNN learner is about its classifications.

**Computing probabilities**

The `where9am` data frame contains 91 days (thirteen weeks) worth of data in which Brett recorded his `location` at 9am each day as well as whether the `daytype` was a weekend or weekday.

Using the conditional probability formula below, you can compute the probability that Brett is working in the office, given that it is a weekday.

 $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\ and\ B)}{P(B)} $

Calculations like these are the basis of the Naive Bayes destination prediction model you'll develop in later exercises.

```{r}
locations <- read.csv("_data/locations.csv")
where9am <- locations %>% 
              filter(hour == 9) %>% 
              select(daytype, location) %>% 
              mutate(across(everything(), as.factor))

# Compute P(A) 
p_A <- nrow(subset(where9am, location == "office")) / nrow(where9am)

# Compute P(B)
p_B <- nrow(subset(where9am, daytype == "weekday")) / nrow(where9am)

# Compute the observed P(A and B)
p_AB <- nrow(subset(where9am, location == "office" & daytype == "weekday")) / nrow(where9am)

# Compute P(A | B) and print its value
p_A_given_B <- p_AB / p_B
p_A_given_B
```

Great work! In a lot of cases, calculating probabilities is as simple as counting.

**A simple Naive Bayes location model**

The previous exercises showed that the probability that Brett is at work or at home at 9am is highly dependent on whether it is the weekend or a weekday.

To see this finding in action, use the `where9am` data frame to build a Naive Bayes model on the same data.

You can then use this model to predict the future: where does the model think that Brett will be at 9am on Thursday and at 9am on Saturday?

The data frame `where9am` is available in your workspace. This dataset contains information about Brett's location at 9am on different days.

```{r}
thursday9am <- where9am[3:4,] %>% filter(daytype == "weekday") %>% select(-location)
saturday9am <- where9am[3:4,] %>% filter(daytype == "weekend") %>% select(-location)
  
# Load the naivebayes package
library(naivebayes)

# Build the location prediction model
locmodel <- naive_bayes(location ~ daytype, data = where9am)

# Predict Thursday's 9am location
predict(locmodel, thursday9am)

# Predict Saturdays's 9am location
predict(locmodel, saturday9am)
```

Awesome job! Not surprisingly, Brett is most likely at the office at 9am on a Thursday, but at home at the same time on a Saturday!

**Examining "raw" probabilities**

The `naivebayes` package offers several ways to peek inside a Naive Bayes model.

Typing the name of the model object provides the `a priori` (overall) and conditional probabilities of each of the model's predictors. If one were so inclined, you might use these for calculating *posterior* (predicted) probabilities by hand.

Alternatively, R will compute the posterior probabilities for you if the `type = "prob"` parameter is supplied to the `predict()` function.

Using these methods, examine how the model's predicted 9am location probability varies from day-to-day. The model `locmodel` that you fit in the previous exercise is in your workspace.

```{r}
# The 'naivebayes' package is loaded into the workspace
# and the Naive Bayes 'locmodel' has been built

# Examine the location prediction model
locmodel

# Obtain the predicted probabilities for Thursday at 9am
predict(locmodel, thursday9am, type = "prob")

# Obtain the predicted probabilities for Saturday at 9am
predict(locmodel, saturday9am, type = "prob")
```

Fantastic! Did you notice the predicted probability of Brett being at the office on a Saturday is zero?

One event is independent of another if knowing one doesn't give you information about how likely the other is. For example, knowing if it's raining in New York doesn't help you predict the weather in San Francisco. The weather events in the two cities are independent of each other.

## Understanding NB's "naivety"

![](_images/1014.png)

![](_images/1015.png)

The joint probability of independent events can be computed much more simply by multiplying their individual probabilities.

![](_images/1016.png)

![](_images/1017.png)

**A more sophisticated location model**

The `locations` dataset records Brett's location every hour for 13 weeks. Each hour, the tracking information includes the `daytype` (weekend or weekday) as well as the `hourtype` (morning, afternoon, evening, or night).

Using this data, build a more sophisticated model to see how Brett's predicted location not only varies by the day of week but also by the time of day. The dataset `locations` is already loaded in your workspace.

You can specify additional independent variables in your formula using the `+` sign (e.g. `y ~ x + b`).

```{r}
# The 'naivebayes' package is loaded into the workspace already
weekday_afternoon <- locations[13,]
weekday_evening <- locations[19,]

# Build a NB model of location
locmodel <- naive_bayes(location ~ daytype + hourtype, data = locations)

# Predict Brett's location on a weekday afternoon
predict(locmodel, weekday_afternoon)

# Predict Brett's location on a weekday evening
predict(locmodel, weekday_evening)
```

Great job! Your Naive Bayes model forecasts that Brett will be at the office on a weekday afternoon and at home in the evening.

**Preparing for unforeseen circumstances**

While Brett was tracking his location over 13 weeks, he never went into the office during the weekend. Consequently, the joint probability of P(office and weekend) = 0.

Explore how this impacts the predicted probability that Brett may go to work on the weekend in the future. Additionally, you can see how using the Laplace correction will allow a small chance for these types of unforeseen circumstances.

The model `locmodel` is already in your workspace, along with the dataframe `weekend_afternoon`.

```{r}
# The 'naivebayes' package is loaded into the workspace already
# The Naive Bayes location model (locmodel) has already been built
weekend_afternoon <- locations[85,] %>% select(daytype, hourtype, location)

# Observe the predicted probabilities for a weekend afternoon
predict(locmodel, weekend_afternoon, type = "prob")

# Build a new model using the Laplace correction
locmodel2 <- naive_bayes(location ~ daytype + hourtype, data = locations, laplace = 1)

# Observe the new predicted probabilities for a weekend afternoon
predict(locmodel2, weekend_afternoon, type = "prob")
```

Fantastic work! Adding the Laplace correction allows for the small chance that Brett might go to the office on the weekend in the future.

**Understanding the Laplace correction**

By default, the `naive_bayes()` function in the `naivebayes` package does not use the Laplace correction. The risk of leaving this parameter unset may lead to some potential outcomes predicted to be impossible.

## Making binary predictions with regression

![](_images/1021.png)

**Building simple logistic regression models**

The `donors` dataset contains 93,462 examples of people mailed in a fundraising solicitation for paralyzed military veterans. The `donated` column is `1` if the person made a donation in response to the mailing and `0` otherwise. This binary outcome will be the dependent variable for the logistic regression model.

The remaining columns are features of the prospective donors that may influence their donation behavior. These are the model's *independent variables*.

When building a regression model, it is often helpful to form a hypothesis about which independent variables will be predictive of the dependent variable. The `bad_address` column, which is set to `1` for an invalid mailing address and `0` otherwise, seems like it might reduce the chances of a donation. Similarly, one might suspect that religious interest (`interest_religion`) and interest in veterans affairs (`interest_veterans`) would be associated with greater charitable giving.

In this exercise, you will use these three factors to create a simple model of donation behavior. The dataset `donors` is available in your workspace.

```{r}
donors <- read.csv("_data/donors.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Examine the dataset to identify potential independent variables
str(donors)

# Explore the dependent variable
table(donors$donated)

# Build the donation model
donation_model <- glm(donated ~ bad_address + interest_religion + interest_veterans, 
                      data = donors, family = "binomial")

# Summarize the model results
summary(donation_model)
```

Great work! With the model built, you can now use it to make predictions!

**Making a binary prediction**

In the previous exercise, you used the `glm()` function to build a logistic regression model of donor behavior. As with many of R's machine learning methods, you can apply the `predict()` function to the model object to forecast future behavior. By default, `predict()` outputs predictions in terms of *log odds* unless `type = "response"` is specified. This converts the log odds to *probabilities*.

Because a logistic regression model estimates the *probability* of the outcome, it is up to you to determine the threshold at which the probability implies action. One must balance the extremes of being too cautious versus being too aggressive. For example, if you were to solicit only the people with a 99% or greater donation probability, you may miss out on many people with lower estimated probabilities that still choose to donate. This balance is particularly important to consider for severely imbalanced outcomes, such as in this dataset where donations are relatively rare.

The dataset `donors` and the model `donation_model` are already loaded in your workspace.

```{r}
# Estimate the donation probability
donors$donation_prob <- predict(donation_model, type = "response")

# Find the donation probability of the average prospect
mean(donors$donated)

# Predict a donation if probability of donation is greater than average
donors$donation_pred <- ifelse(donors$donation_prob > 0.0504, 1, 0)

# Calculate the model's accuracy
mean(donors$donated == donors$donation_pred)
```

Nice work! With an accuracy of nearly 80%, the model seems to be doing its job. But is it too good to be true?

With an accuracy of only 80%, the model is actually performing WORSE than if it were to predict non-donor for every record.

## Model performance tradeoffs

![](_images/1022.png)

![](_images/1023.png)

![](_images/1024.png)

When AUC values are very close, it's important to know more about how the model will be used.

**Calculating ROC Curves and AUC**

The previous exercises have demonstrated that accuracy is a very misleading measure of model performance on imbalanced datasets. Graphing the model's performance better illustrates the tradeoff between a model that is overly aggressive and one that is overly passive.

In this exercise you will create a ROC curve and compute the area under the curve (AUC) to evaluate the logistic regression model of donations you built earlier.

The dataset `donors` with the column of predicted probabilities, `donation_prob`,is already loaded in your workspace.

```{r}
# Load the pROC package
library(pROC)

# Create a ROC curve
ROC <- roc(donors$donated, donors$donation_prob)

# Plot the ROC curve
plot(ROC, col = "blue")

# Calculate the area under the curve (AUC)
auc(ROC)
```

Awesome job! Based on this visualization, the model isn't doing much better than baseline— a model doing nothing but making predictions at random.

## Dummy variables, missing data, and interactions

![](_images/1025.png)

![](_images/1026.png)

![](_images/1027.png)

**Coding categorical features**

Sometimes a dataset contains numeric values that represent a categorical feature.

In the `donors` dataset, `wealth_rating` uses numbers to indicate the donor's wealth level:

- **0** = Unknown
- **1** = Low
- **2** = Medium
- **3** = High

This exercise illustrates how to prepare this type of categorical feature and examines its impact on a logistic regression model. The dataframe `donors` is loaded in your workspace.

```{r}
# Convert the wealth rating to a factor
donors$wealth_levels <- factor(donors$wealth_rating, levels = c(0, 1, 2, 3), labels = c("Unknown", "Low", "Medium", "High"))

# Use relevel() to change reference category
donors$wealth_levels <- relevel(donors$wealth_levels, ref = "Medium")

# See how our factor coding impacts the model
summary(glm(donated ~ wealth_levels, data = donors, family = "binomial"))
```

Great job! What would the model output have looked like if this variable had been left as a numeric column?

**Handling missing data**

Some of the prospective donors have missing `age` data. Unfortunately, R will exclude any cases with `NA` values when building a regression model.

One workaround is to replace, or **impute**, the missing values with an estimated value. After doing so, you may also create a missing data indicator to model the possibility that cases with missing data are different in some way from those without.

The dataframe `donors` is loaded in your workspace.

```{r}
# Find the average age among non-missing values
summary(donors$age)

# Impute missing age values with the mean age
donors$imputed_age <- ifelse(is.na(donors$age), round(mean(donors$age, na.rm = TRUE), 2), donors$age)

# Create missing value indicator for age
donors$missing_age <- ifelse(is.na(donors$age), 1, 0)
```

Super! This is one way to handle missing data, but be careful! Sometimes missing data has to be dealt with using more complicated methods.

**Understanding missing value indicators**

A missing value indicator provides a reminder that, before imputation, there was a missing value present on the record.

It is often useful to include this indicator as a predictor in the model, because:

- A missing value may represent a unique category by itself

- There may be an important difference between records with and without missing data

- Whatever caused the missing value may also be related to the outcome

**Building a more sophisticated model**

One of the best predictors of future giving is a history of recent, frequent, and large gifts. In marketing terms, this is known as R/F/M:

- Recency
- Frequency
- Money

Donors that haven't given both recently and frequently may be especially likely to give again; in other words, the *combined* impact of recency and frequency may be greater than the sum of the separate effects.

Because these predictors together have a greater impact on the dependent variable, their joint effect must be modeled as an interaction. The `donors` dataset has been loaded for you.

```{r}
# Build a recency, frequency, and money (RFM) model
rfm_model <- glm(donated ~ recency * frequency + money, data = donors, family = "binomial")

# Summarize the RFM model to see how the parameters were coded
summary(rfm_model)

# Compute predicted probabilities for the RFM model
rfm_prob <- predict(rfm_model, data = donors, type = "response")

# Plot the ROC curve for the new model
library(pROC)
ROC <- roc(donors$donated, rfm_prob)
plot(ROC, col = "red")
auc(ROC)
```

Great work! Based on the ROC curve, you've confirmed that past giving patterns are certainly predictive of future giving.

## Automatic feature selection

![](_images/1028.png)

**The dangers of stepwise regression**

In spite of its utility for feature selection, stepwise regression is not frequently used in disciplines outside of machine learning due to some important caveats. 

- It is not guaranteed to find the best possible model
- The stepwise regression procedure violates some statistical assumptions
- It can result in a model that makes little sense in the real world

Though stepwise regression is frowned upon, it may still be useful for building predictive models in the absence of another starting place.

**Building a stepwise regression model**

In the absence of subject-matter expertise, **stepwise regression** can assist with the search for the most important predictors of the outcome of interest.

In this exercise, you will use a forward stepwise approach to add predictors to the model one-by-one until no additional benefit is seen. The `donors` dataset has been loaded for you.

```{r}

donors <- donors %>% select(-age, -wealth_levels, -donation_prob, -donation_pred) %>% drop_na()

# Specify a null model with no predictors
null_model <- glm(donated ~ 1, data = donors, family = "binomial")

# Specify the full model using all of the potential predictors
full_model <- glm(donated ~ ., data = donors, family = "binomial")

# Use a forward stepwise algorithm to build a parsimonious model
step_model <- step(null_model, scope = list(lower = null_model, upper = full_model), direction = "forward")

# Estimate the stepwise donation probability
step_prob <- predict(step_model, type = "response")

# Plot the ROC of the stepwise model
library(pROC)
ROC <- roc(donors$donated, step_prob)
plot(ROC, col = "red")
auc(ROC)
```

Fantastic work! Despite the caveats of stepwise regression, it seems to have resulted in a relatively strong model!

**Building a simple decision tree**

The `loans` dataset contains 11,312 randomly-selected people who applied for and later received loans from Lending Club, a US-based peer-to-peer lending company.

You will use a decision tree to try to learn patterns in the outcome of these loans (either repaid or default) based on the requested loan amount and credit score at the time of application.

Then, see how the tree's predictions differ for an applicant with good credit versus one with bad credit.

The dataset `loans` is already in your workspace.

```{r}
loans <- read.csv("_data/loans.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
good_credit <- loans[18,]
bad_credit <- loans[8,]

loans <- loans %>% mutate(outcome = factor(!default, labels = c("default", "repaid"))) %>% 
                   filter(keep == 1) %>% 
                   select(-keep, -rand, -default)

# Load the rpart package
library(rpart)

# Build a lending model predicting loan outcome versus loan amount and credit score
loan_model <- rpart(outcome ~ loan_amount + credit_score, data = loans, method = "class", control = rpart.control(cp = 0))

# Make a prediction for someone with good credit
predict(loan_model, good_credit, type = "class")

# Make a prediction for someone with bad credit
predict(loan_model, bad_credit, type = "class")
```

Great job! Growing a decision tree is certainly faster than growing a real tree!

**Visualizing classification trees**

Due to government rules to prevent illegal discrimination, lenders are required to explain why a loan application was rejected.

The structure of classification trees can be depicted visually, which helps to understand how the tree makes its decisions. The model `loan_model` that you fit in the last exercise is in your workspace.

```{r}
# Examine the loan_model object
loan_model

# Load the rpart.plot package
library(rpart.plot)

# Plot the loan_model with default settings
rpart.plot(loan_model)

# Plot the loan_model with customized settings
rpart.plot(loan_model, type = 3, box.palette = c("red", "green"), fallen.leaves = TRUE)
```

Awesome! What do you think of the fancy visualization?

## Growing larger classification trees

![](_images/1033.png)

- split A is chosen first, as it is the most "pure," i.e. homogenous.
- Divide-and-conquer always looks to create the split resulting in the greatest improvement to purity.

![](_images/1036.png)

**Creating random test datasets**

Before building a more sophisticated lending model, it is important to hold out a portion of the loan data to simulate how well it will predict the outcomes of future loan applicants.

As depicted in the above image, you can use 75% of the observations for training and 25% for testing the model.

The `sample()` function can be used to generate a random sample of rows to include in the training set. Simply supply it the total number of observations and the number needed for training.

Use the resulting vector of row IDs to subset the loans into training and testing datasets. The dataset `loans` is loaded in your workspace.

```{r}
# Determine the number of rows for training
nrow(loans) * 0.75

# Create a random sample of row IDs
sample_rows <- sample(nrow(loans), nrow(loans) * 0.75)

# Create the training dataset
loans_train <- loans[sample_rows, ]

# Create the test dataset
loans_test <- loans[-sample_rows, ]
```

Amazing work! Creating a test set is an easy way to check your model's performance.

**Building and evaluating a larger tree**

Previously, you created a simple decision tree that used the applicant's credit score and requested loan amount to predict the loan outcome.

Lending Club has additional information about the applicants, such as home ownership status, length of employment, loan purpose, and past bankruptcies, that may be useful for making more accurate predictions.

Using all of the available applicant data, build a more sophisticated lending model using the random training dataset created previously. Then, use this model to make predictions on the testing dataset to estimate the performance of the model on future loan applications.

The `rpart` package is loaded into the workspace and the `loans_train` and `loans_test` datasets have been created.

```{r}
# Grow a tree using all of the available applicant data
loan_model <- rpart(outcome ~ ., data = loans_train, method = "class", control = rpart.control(cp = 0))

# Make predictions on the test dataset
loans_test$pred <- predict(loan_model, loans_test, type = "class")

# Examine the confusion matrix
table(loans_test$pred, loans_test$outcome)

# Compute the accuracy on the test dataset
mean(loans_test$pred == loans_test$outcome)
```

Awesome! How did adding more predictors change the model's performance?

**Preventing overgrown trees**

The tree grown on the full set of applicant data grew to be extremely large and extremely complex, with hundreds of splits and leaf nodes containing only a handful of applicants. This tree would be almost impossible for a loan officer to interpret.

Using the **pre-pruning** methods for early stopping, you can prevent a tree from growing too large and complex. See how the `rpart` control options for maximum tree depth and minimum split count impact the resulting tree.

`rpart` is loaded.

```{r}
# Grow a tree with maxdepth of 6
loan_model <- rpart(outcome ~ ., data = loans_train, method = "class", control = rpart.control(cp = 0, maxdepth = 6))

# Make a class prediction on the test set
loans_test$pred <- predict(loan_model, loans_test, type = "class")

# Compute the accuracy of the simpler tree
mean(loans_test$pred == loans_test$outcome)

# Swap maxdepth for a minimum split of 500 
loan_model <- rpart(outcome ~ ., data = loans_train, method = "class", control = rpart.control(cp = 0, minsplit = 500))

# Run this. How does the accuracy change?
loans_test$pred <- predict(loan_model, loans_test, type = "class")
mean(loans_test$pred == loans_test$outcome)
```

Nice work! It may seem surprising, but creating a simpler decision tree may actually result in greater performance on the test dataset.

**Creating a nicely pruned tree**

Stopping a tree from growing all the way can lead it to ignore some aspects of the data or miss important trends it may have discovered later.

By using **post-pruning**, you can intentionally grow a large and complex tree then prune it to be smaller and more efficient later on.

In this exercise, you will have the opportunity to construct a visualization of the tree's performance versus complexity, and use this information to prune the tree to an appropriate level.

The `rpart` package is loaded into the workspace, along with `loans_test` and `loans_train`.

```{r}
# Grow an overly complex tree
loan_model <- rpart(outcome ~ ., data = loans_train, method = "class", control = rpart.control(cp = 0))

# Examine the complexity plot
plotcp(loan_model)

# Prune the tree
loan_model_pruned <- prune(loan_model, cp = 0.0014)

# Compute the accuracy of the pruned tree
loans_test$pred <- predict(loan_model_pruned, loans_test, type = "class")
mean(loans_test$pred == loans_test$outcome)
```

Great job! As with pre-pruning, creating a simpler tree actually improved the performance of the tree on the test dataset.

**Why do trees benefit from pruning?**

Classification trees can grow indefinitely, until they are told to stop or run out of data to divide-and-conquer.

Just like trees in nature, classification trees that grow overly large can require pruning to reduce the excess growth. However, this generally results in a tree that classifies fewer training examples correctly.

Pre-pruning and post-pruning are almost always used because:

- Simpler trees are easier to interpret
- Simpler trees using early stopping are faster to train
- Simpler trees may perform better on the testing data

**Understanding random forests**

Groups of classification trees can be combined into an ensemble that generates a single prediction by allowing the trees to "vote" on the outcome.

This could result in more accurate predictions than a single tree because the diversity among the trees may lead it to discover more subtle patterns.

The teamwork-based approach of the random forest may help it find important trends a single tree may miss.

**Building a random forest model**

In spite of the fact that a forest can contain hundreds of trees, growing a decision tree forest is perhaps even easier than creating a single highly-tuned tree.

Using the `randomForest` package, build a random forest and see how it compares to the single trees you built previously.

Keep in mind that due to the random nature of the forest, the results may vary slightly each time you create the forest.

```{r}
# Load the randomForest package
library(randomForest)

# Build a random forest model
loan_model <- randomForest(outcome ~ ., data = loans_train)

# Compute the accuracy of the random forest
loans_test$pred <- predict(loan_model, loans_test)
mean(loans_test$pred == loans_test$outcome)
```

Wow! Great job! Now you're really a classification pro! Classification is only one of the problems you'll have to tackle as a data scientist. Check out some other machine learning courses to learn more about supervised and unsupervised learning.
