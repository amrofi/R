**Loading the gapminder and dplyr packages**

Before you can work with the `gapminder` dataset, you'll need to load two R packages that contain the tools for working with it, then display the `gapminder` dataset so that you can see what it contains.

*This course introduces a lot of new concepts, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the* [tidyverse for beginners Cheat Sheet](https://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/e63a8f6b-2aa3-4006-89e0-badc294b179c) *and keep it handy!*

```{r Loading-the-gapminder-and-dplyr-packages}
# Load the gapminder package
library(gapminder)

# Load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# Look at the gapminder dataset
gapminder
```

**The filter verb**

![](_images/491.png)

![](_images/492.png)

![](_images/493.png)

**Filtering for one year**

The `filter` verb extracts particular observations based on a condition. In this exercise you'll filter for observations from a particular year.

```{r Filtering-for-one-year}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Filter the gapminder dataset for the year 1957
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1957)
```

**Filtering for one country and one year**

You can also use the `filter()` verb to set two conditions, which could retrieve a single observation.

Just like in the last exercise, you can do this in two lines of code, starting with `gapminder %>%` and having the `filter()` on the second line. Keeping one verb on each line helps keep the code readable. Note that each time, you'll put the pipe `%>%` at the end of the first line (like `gapminder %>%`); putting the pipe at the beginning of the second line will throw an error.

```{r Filtering-for-one-country-and-one-year}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Filter for China in 2002
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "China", year == 2002)
```

**The arrange verb**

![](_images/494.png)

![](_images/495.png)

![](_images/496.png)

**Arranging observations by life expectancy**

You use `arrange()` to sort observations in ascending or descending order of a particular variable. In this case, you'll sort the dataset based on the `lifeExp` variable.

```{r Arranging-observations-by-life-expectancy}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Sort in ascending order of lifeExp
gapminder %>%
  arrange(lifeExp)
  
# Sort in descending order of lifeExp
gapminder %>%
  arrange(desc(lifeExp))
```

That's right! Take a look at the countries with the highest and lowest life expectancy- is it similar to what you expected?

**Filtering and arranging**

You'll often need to use the pipe operator (`%>%`) to combine multiple dplyr verbs in a row. In this case, you'll combine a `filter()` with an `arrange()` to find the highest population countries in a particular year.

```{r Filtering-and-arranging}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Filter for the year 1957, then arrange in descending order of population
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1957) %>%
  arrange(desc(pop))
```

Great work! A lot of the exercises in this course will involve combining multiple steps with the `%>%` operator.

**The mutate verb**

![](_images/497.png)

![](_images/498.png)

![](_images/499.png)

**Using mutate to change or create a column**

Suppose we want life expectancy to be measured in months instead of years: you'd have to multiply the existing value by 12. You can use the `mutate()` verb to change this column, or to create a new column that's calculated this way.

```{r Using-mutate-to-change-or-create-a-column}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Use mutate to change lifeExp to be in months
gapminder %>%
  mutate(lifeExp = lifeExp * 12)

# Use mutate to create a new column called lifeExpMonths
gapminder %>%
  mutate(lifeExpMonths = lifeExp * 12)
```

**Combining filter, mutate, and arrange**

In this exercise, you'll combine all three of the verbs you've learned in this chapter, to find the countries with the highest life expectancy, in months, in the year 2007.

```{r Combining-filter,-mutate,-and-arrange}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Filter, mutate, and arrange the gapminder dataset
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  mutate(lifeExpMonths = 12 * lifeExp) %>%
  arrange(desc(lifeExpMonths))
```

Great work! Notice how you can combine several `dplyr` operations to answer a more complicated question like this.

**Visualizing with ggplot2**

**Variable assignment**

Throughout the exercises in this chapter, you'll be visualizing a subset of the gapminder data from the year 1952. First, you'll have to load the ggplot2 package, and create a `gapminder_1952` dataset to visualize.

*By the way, if you haven't downloaded it already, check out the* [tidyverse for beginners Cheat Sheet](https://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/e63a8f6b-2aa3-4006-89e0-badc294b179c)*. It includes an overview of the most important concepts, functions and methods and might come in handy if you ever need a quick refresher!*

```{r Variable-assignment}
# Load the ggplot2 package as well
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Create gapminder_1952
gapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952)
```

**Comparing population and GDP per capita**

In the video you learned to create a scatter plot with GDP per capita on the x-axis and life expectancy on the y-axis (the code for that graph is shown here). When you're exploring data visually, you'll often need to try different combinations of variables and aesthetics.

```{r Comparing-population-and-GDP-per-capita}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

gapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952)

# Change to put pop on the x-axis and gdpPercap on the y-axis
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point()
```

Great work on your first graph! Each point represents a country: can you guess which country any of the points are?

**Comparing population and life expectancy**

In this exercise, you'll use `ggplot2` to create a scatter plot from scratch, to compare each country's population with its life expectancy in the year 1952.

```{r Comparing-population-and-life-expectancy}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

gapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952)

# Create a scatter plot with pop on the x-axis and lifeExp on the y-axis
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

Great! You might notice the points are crowded towards the left side of the plot, making them hard to distinguish. This next video will help solve that problem.

**Log scales**

**Putting the x-axis on a log scale**

You previously created a scatter plot with population on the x-axis and life expectancy on the y-axis. Since population is spread over several orders of magnitude, with some countries having a much higher population than others, it's a good idea to put the x-axis on a log scale.

```{r Putting-the-x-axis-on-a-log-scale}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

gapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952)

# Change this plot to put the x-axis on a log scale
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

Great! Notice the points are more spread out on the x-axis. This makes it easy to see that there isn't a correlation between population and life expectancy.

**Putting the x- and y- axes on a log scale**

Suppose you want to create a scatter plot with population on the x-axis and GDP per capita on the y-axis. Both population and GDP per-capita are better represented with log scales, since they vary over many orders of magnitude.

```{r Putting-the-x-and-y-axes-on-a-log-scale}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

gapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952)

# Scatter plot comparing pop and gdpPercap, with both axes on a log scale
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

Great! Notice that the y-axis goes from 1e3 (1000) to 1e4 (10,000) to 1e5 (100,000) in equal increments.

**Additional aesthetics**

![](_images/500.png)

![](_images/501.png)

![](_images/502.png)

**Adding color to a scatter plot**

In this lesson you learned how to use the color aesthetic, which can be used to show which continent each point in a scatter plot represents.

```{r Adding-color-to-a-scatter-plot}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

gapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952)

# Scatter plot comparing pop and lifeExp, with color representing continent
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

Good work! What differences can you see between continents, in terms of their population and life expectancy?

**Adding size and color to a plot**

In the last exercise, you created a scatter plot communicating information about each country's population, life expectancy, and continent. Now you'll use the size of the points to communicate even more.

```{r Adding-size-and-color-to-a-plot}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

gapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952)

# Add the size aesthetic to represent a country's gdpPercap
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

Good work! Are you able to guess which point represents your own country?

**Faceting**

![](_images/503.png)

**Creating a subgraph for each continent**

You've learned to use faceting to divide a graph into subplots based on one of its variables, such as the continent.

```{r Creating-a-subgraph-for-each-continent}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

gapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952)

# Scatter plot comparing pop and lifeExp, faceted by continent
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent)
```

Great work! Faceting is a powerful way to understand subsets of your data separately.

**Faceting by year**

All of the graphs in this chapter have been visualizing statistics within one year. Now that you're able to use faceting, however, you can create a graph showing **all** the country-level data from 1952 to 2007, to understand how global statistics have changed over time.

```{r Faceting-by-year}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Scatter plot comparing gdpPercap and lifeExp, with color representing continent
# and size representing population, faceted by year
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~ year)
```

Awesome! That's a lot of information you're now able to share in one graph.

**The summarize verb**

![](_images/504.png)

![](_images/505.png)

![](_images/506.png)

**Summarizing the median life expectancy**

You've seen how to find the mean life expectancy and the total population across a set of observations, but `mean()` and `sum()` are only two of the functions R provides for summarizing a collection of numbers. Here, you'll learn to use the `median()` function in combination with `summarize()`.

By the way, `dplyr` displays some messages when it's loaded that we've been hiding so far. They'll show up in red and start with:

```
Attaching package: 'dplyr'

The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
```

This will occur in future exercises each time you load `dplyr`: it's mentioning some built-in functions that are overwritten by `dplyr`. You won't need to worry about this message within this course.

```{r Summarizing-the-median-life-expectancy}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Summarize to find the median life expectancy
gapminder %>%
  summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp))
```

That's right! Note that this is the median across all countries and all years in the dataset.

**Summarizing the median life expectancy in 1957**

Rather than summarizing the entire dataset, you may want to find the median life expectancy for only one particular year. In this case, you'll find the median in the year 1957.

```{r Summarizing-the-median-life-expectancy-in-1957}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Filter for 1957 then summarize the median life expectancy
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1957) %>%
  summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp))
```

Great! Just like in Chapter 1, this chapter will often involve performing multiple `dplyr` steps in a row.

**Summarizing multiple variables in 1957**

The `summarize()` verb allows you to summarize multiple variables at once. In this case, you'll use the `median()` function to find the median life expectancy and the `max()` function to find the maximum GDP per capita.

```{r Summarizing-multiple-variables-in-1957}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Filter for 1957 then summarize the median life expectancy and the maximum GDP per capita
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1957) %>%
  summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp),
            maxGdpPercap = max(gdpPercap))
```

That's right! Think about what other kinds of information about countries you might want to summarize within one year.

**The group_by verb**

![](_images/507.png)

![](_images/508.png)

![](_images/509.png)

**Summarizing by year**

In a previous exercise, you found the median life expectancy and the maximum GDP per capita in the year 1957. Now, you'll perform those two summaries within each year in the dataset, using the `group_by` verb.

```{r Summarizing-by-year}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Find median life expectancy and maximum GDP per capita in each year
gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp),
            maxGdpPercap = max(gdpPercap))
```

Great! Interesting: notice that median life expectancy across countries is generally going up over time, but maximum GDP per capita is not.

**Summarizing by continent**

You can group by any variable in your dataset to create a summary. Rather than comparing across time, you might be interested in comparing among continents. You'll want to do that within one year of the dataset: let's use 1957.

```{r Summarizing-by-continent}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Find median life expectancy and maximum GDP per capita in each continent in 1957
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1957) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp),
            maxGdpPercap = max(gdpPercap))
```

Great work! Which continent had the highest median life expectancy in 1957?

**Summarizing by continent and year**

Instead of grouping just by year, or just by continent, you'll now group by both continent and year to summarize within each.

```{r Summarizing-by-continent-and-year}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)

# Find median life expectancy and maximum GDP per capita in each continent/year combination
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp),
            maxGdpPercap = max(gdpPercap))
```

Excellent! In the next chapter, you'll learn to turn this data into an informative graph.

**Visualizing summarized data**

**Visualizing median life expectancy over time**

In the last chapter, you summarized the gapminder data to calculate the median life expectancy within each year. This code is provided for you, and is saved (with `<-`) as the `by_year` dataset.

Now you can use the ggplot2 package to turn this into a visualization of changing life expectancy over time.

```{r Visualizing-median-life-expectancy-over-time}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

by_year <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp),
            maxGdpPercap = max(gdpPercap))

# Create a scatter plot showing the change in medianLifeExp over time
ggplot(by_year, aes(x = year, y = medianLifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  expand_limits(y = 0)
```

Great! It looks like median life expectancy across countries is increasing over time.

**Visualizing median GDP per capita per continent over time**

In the last exercise you were able to see how the median life expectancy of countries changed over time. Now you'll examine the median GDP per capita instead, and see how the trend differs among continents.

```{r Visualizing-median-GDP-per-capita-per-continent-over-time}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Summarize medianGdpPercap within each continent within each year: by_year_continent
by_year_continent <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarize(medianGdpPercap = median(gdpPercap))

# Plot the change in medianGdpPercap in each continent over time
ggplot(by_year_continent, aes(x = year, y = medianGdpPercap, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  expand_limits(y = 0)
```

Great! You might be wondering how you can connect these points with lines. You'll learn that in Chapter 4!

**Comparing median life expectancy and median GDP per continent in 2007**

In these exercises you've generally created plots that show change over time. But as another way of exploring your data visually, you can also use ggplot2 to plot summarized data to compare continents within a single year.

```{r Comparing-median-life-expectancy-and-median-GDP-per-continent-in-2007}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Summarize the median GDP and median life expectancy per continent in 2007
by_continent_2007 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(medianGdpPercap = median(gdpPercap),
            medianLifeExp = median(lifeExp))

# Use a scatter plot to compare the median GDP and median life expectancy
ggplot(by_continent_2007, aes(x = medianGdpPercap, y = medianLifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point()
```

Great work! Scatter plots are a very flexible tool for examining relationships.

**Line plots**

![](_images/510.png)

**Visualizing median GDP per capita over time**

A line plot is useful for visualizing trends over time. In this exercise, you'll examine how the median GDP per capita has changed over time.

```{r Visualizing-median-GDP-per-capita-over-time}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Summarize the median gdpPercap by year, then save it as by_year
by_year <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(medianGdpPercap = median(gdpPercap))

# Create a line plot showing the change in medianGdpPercap over time
ggplot(by_year, aes(x = year, y = medianGdpPercap)) +
  geom_line() +
  expand_limits(y = 0)
```

Great! Looks like median GDP per capita across countries has gone up over time.

**Visualizing median GDP per capita by continent over time**

In the last exercise you used a line plot to visualize the increase in median GDP per capita over time. Now you'll examine the change within each continent.

```{r Visualizing-median-GDP-per-capita-by-continent-over-time}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Summarize the median gdpPercap by year & continent, save as by_year_continent
by_year_continent <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(year, continent) %>%
  summarize(medianGdpPercap = median(gdpPercap))

# Create a line plot showing the change in medianGdpPercap by continent over time
ggplot(by_year_continent, aes(x = year, y = medianGdpPercap, color = continent)) +
  geom_line() +
  expand_limits(y = 0)
```

Excellent work! Take a look at the plot: did the growth in median GDP per capita differ between continents?

**Bar plots**

**Visualizing median GDP per capita by continent**

A bar plot is useful for visualizing summary statistics, such as the median GDP in each continent.

```{r Visualizing-median-GDP-per-capita-by-continent}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Summarize the median gdpPercap by continent in 1952
by_continent <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(medianGdpPercap = median(gdpPercap))

# Create a bar plot showing medianGdp by continent
ggplot(by_continent, aes(x = continent, y = medianGdpPercap)) +
  geom_col()
```

Excellent! That's three kinds of plots you're now able to make with ggplot2.

**Visualizing GDP per capita by country in Oceania**

You've created a plot where each bar represents one continent, showing the median GDP per capita for each. But the x-axis of the bar plot doesn't have to be the continent: you can instead create a bar plot where each bar represents a country.

In this exercise, you'll create a bar plot comparing the GDP per capita between the two countries in the Oceania continent (Australia and New Zealand).

```{r Visualizing-GDP-per-capita-by-country-in-Oceania}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Filter for observations in the Oceania continent in 1952
oceania_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Oceania", year == 1952)

# Create a bar plot of gdpPercap by country
ggplot(oceania_1952, aes(x = country, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_col()
```

Good work! Looks like the GDP per capita of these two countries was similar in 1952.

**Histograms**

**Visualizing population**

A histogram is useful for examining the distribution of a numeric variable. In this exercise, you'll create a histogram showing the distribution of country populations (by millions) in the year 1952.

Code for generating this dataset, `gapminder_1952`, is provided.

```{r Visualizing-population}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

gapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952) %>%
  mutate(pop_by_mil = pop / 1000000)

# Create a histogram of population (pop_by_mil)
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop_by_mil)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50)
```

That's right! Notice that most of the distribution is in the smallest (leftmost) bins. In the next exercise you'll put the x-axis on a log scale.

**Visualizing population with x-axis on a log scale**

In the last exercise you created a histogram of populations across countries. You might have noticed that there were several countries with a much higher population than others, which causes the distribution to be very skewed, with most of the distribution crammed into a small part of the graph. (Consider that it's hard to tell the median or the minimum population from that histogram).

To make the histogram more informative, you can try putting the x-axis on a log scale.

```{r Visualizing-population-with-x-axis-on-a-log-scale}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

gapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952)

# Create a histogram of population (pop), with x on a log scale
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = pop)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

Great! Notice that on a log scale, the distribution of country populations is approximately symmetrical.

**Boxplots**

**Comparing GDP per capita across continents**

A boxplot is useful for comparing a distribution of values across several groups. In this exercise, you'll examine the distribution of GDP per capita by continent. Since GDP per capita varies across several orders of magnitude, you'll need to put the y-axis on a log scale.

```{r Comparing-GDP-per-capita-across-continents}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

gapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952)

# Create a boxplot comparing gdpPercap among continents
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

Looks good! What continents had countries with the highest GDP per capita?

**Adding a title to your graph**

There are many other options for customizing a `ggplot2` graph, which you can learn about in other DataCamp courses. You can also learn about them from online resources, which is an important skill to develop.

As the final exercise in this course, you'll practice looking up `ggplot2` instructions by completing a task we haven't shown you how to do.

```{r Adding-a-title-to-your-graph}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
