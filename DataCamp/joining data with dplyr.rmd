## The inner_join verb

**Joining parts and part categories**

The `inner_join` is the key to bring tables together. To use it, you need to provide the two tables that must be joined and the columns on which they should be joined.

In this exercise, you'll join a list of LEGO parts, available as `parts`, with these parts' corresponding categories, available as `part_categories`. For example, the part `Sticker Sheet 1 for Set 1650-1` is from the `Stickers` part category. You can join these tables to see all parts' categories!

```{r}
parts <- readRDS("_data/parts.rds")
part_categories <- readRDS("_data/part_categories.rds")

library(dplyr)

# Add the correct verb, table, and joining column
parts %>% 
    inner_join(part_categories, by = c("part_cat_id" = "id"))

# Use the suffix argument to replace .x and .y suffixes
parts %>% 
	inner_join(part_categories, by = c("part_cat_id" = "id"), 
				suffix = c("_part", "_category"))
```

Great job! You can now see the part category associated with each part, and you used the `suffix` argument to make sure your table's fields are clear.

## Joining with a one-to-many relationship

**Joining parts and inventories**

The LEGO data has many tables that can be joined together. Often times, some of the things you care about may be a few tables away (we'll get to that later in the course). For now, we know that `parts` is a list of all LEGO parts, and a new table, `inventory_parts`, has some additional information about those parts, such as the `color_id` of each part you would find in a specific LEGO kit.

Let's join these two tables together to observe how joining `parts` with `inventory_parts` increases the size of your table because of the one-to-many relationship that exists between these two tables.

```{r}
inventory_parts <- readRDS("_data/inventory_parts.rds")

# Combine the parts and inventory_parts tables
parts %>%
	inner_join(inventory_parts, by = "part_num")
```

Awesome! Recall, this is an example of a one-to-many relationship. Notice that the table increased in the number of rows after the join.

**Joining in either direction**

An `inner_join` works the same way with either table in either position. The table that is specified first is arbitrary, since you will end up with the same information in the resulting table either way.

Let's prove this by joining the same two tables from the last exercise in the opposite order!

```{r}
# Combine the parts and inventory_parts tables
inventory_parts %>%
	inner_join(parts, by = "part_num")
```

Great! This is the same join as the last exercise, but the order of the tables is reversed. For an `inner_join`, either direction will yield a table that contains the same information! Note that the columns will appear in a different order depending on which table comes first.

## Joining three or more tables

![](_images/517.png)

**Joining three tables**

You can string together multiple joins with `inner_join` and the pipe (`%>%`), both with which you are already very familiar!

We'll now connect `sets`, a table that tells us about each LEGO kit, with `inventories`, a table that tells us the specific version of a given set, and finally to `inventory_parts`, a table which tells us how many of each part is available in each LEGO kit.

So if you were building a Batman LEGO set, `sets` would tell you the name of the set, `inventories` would give you IDs for each of the versions of the set, and `inventory_parts` would tell you how many of each part would be in each version.

```{r}
sets <- readRDS("_data/sets.rds")
inventories <- readRDS("_data/inventories.rds")

sets %>%
	# Add inventories using an inner join 
	inner_join(inventories, by = "set_num") %>%
	# Add inventory_parts using an inner join 
	inner_join(inventory_parts, by = c("id" = "inventory_id"))
```

Nice! You joined together multiple tables using `inner_join()` and the pipe!

**What's the most common color?**

Now let's join an additional table, `colors`, which will tell us the color of each part in each set, so that we can answer the question, "what is the most common color of a LEGO piece?"

```{r}
colors <- readRDS("_data/colors.rds")

# Add an inner join for the colors table
sets %>%
	inner_join(inventories, by = "set_num") %>%
	inner_join(inventory_parts, by = c("id" = "inventory_id")) %>%
	inner_join(colors, by = c("color_id" = "id"), suffix=c("_set", "_color"))

# Count the number of colors and sort
sets %>%
	inner_join(inventories, by = "set_num") %>%
	inner_join(inventory_parts, by = c("id" = "inventory_id")) %>%
	inner_join(colors, by = c("color_id" = "id"), suffix = c("_set", "_color")) %>%
	count(name_color, sort = TRUE)
```

Great! Notice that Black and White are the two most prominent colors.

##The left_join verb

![](_images/518.png)

**Left joining two sets by part and color**

In the video, you learned how to left join two LEGO sets. Now you'll practice your ability to do this looking at two new sets: the Millennium Falcon and Star Destroyer sets. We've created these for you and they have been preloaded for you:

```
millennium_falcon <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
  filter(set_num == "7965-1")
```
```
star_destroyer <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
  filter(set_num == "75190-1")
```

```{r}
inventory_parts_joined <- sets %>%
	inner_join(inventories, by = "set_num") %>%
	inner_join(inventory_parts, by = c("id" = "inventory_id")) %>%
	inner_join(colors, by = c("color_id" = "id"), suffix=c("_set", "_color")) %>%
  select(c("set_num", "part_num", "color_id", "quantity")) %>% arrange(desc(quantity))

millennium_falcon <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
  filter(set_num == "7965-1")

star_destroyer <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
  filter(set_num == "75190-1")

# Combine the star_destroyer and millennium_falcon tables
millennium_falcon %>%
  left_join(star_destroyer, by = c("part_num", "color_id"), suffix = c("_falcon", "_star_destroyer"))
```

Awesome! Using this table, and the `part_num` or `color_id` columns, you can determine the frequency that a specific part or piece appears in the Millennium Falcon and Star Destroyer sets!

**Left joining two sets by color**

In the videos and the last exercise, you joined two sets based on their part and color. What if you joined the datasets by color alone? As with the last exercise, the Millennium Falcon and Star Destroyer sets have been created and preloaded for you:

```
millennium_falcon <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
  filter(set_num == "7965-1")
```
```
star_destroyer <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
  filter(set_num == "75190-1")
```

```{r}
# Aggregate Millennium Falcon for the total quantity in each part
millennium_falcon_colors <- millennium_falcon %>%
  group_by(color_id) %>%
  summarize(total_quantity = sum(quantity))

# Aggregate Star Destroyer for the total quantity in each part
star_destroyer_colors <- star_destroyer %>%
  group_by(color_id) %>%
  summarize(total_quantity = sum(quantity))

# Left join the Millennium Falcon colors to the Star Destroyer colors
millennium_falcon_colors %>%
  left_join(star_destroyer_colors, by = "color_id", suffix= c("_falcon", "_star_destroyer"))
```

That's right! Sometimes, the level on which you're comparing two sets- by piece or just by color- will require some thought and some pre-processing.

**Finding an observation that doesn't have a match**

Left joins are really great for testing your assumptions about a data set and ensuring your data has integrity.

For example, the `inventories` table has a `version` column, for when a LEGO kit gets some kind of change or upgrade. It would be fair to assume that all `sets` (which joins well with `inventories`) would have at least a version 1. But let's test this assumption out in the following exercise.

```{r}
inventory_version_1 <- inventories %>%
	filter(version == 1)

# Join versions to sets
sets %>%
  left_join(inventory_version_1, by = "set_num") %>%
  # Filter for where version is na
  filter(is.na(version))
```

Hey! It looks like there are cases where a set does not have an original version. In Chapter 3, you'll learn another way to find observations like this: `anti_join`.

## The right-join verb

![](_images/519.png)

**Counting part colors**

Sometimes you'll want to do some processing before you do a join, *and* prioritize keeping the second (right) table's rows instead. In this case, a right join is for you.

In the example below, we'll count the `part_cat_id` from parts, before using a `right_join` to join with `part_categories`. The reason we do this is because we don't only want to know the count of `part_cat_id` in `parts`, but we also want to know if there are any `part_cat_id`s *not* present in `parts`.

```{r}
parts %>%
	# Count the part_cat_id
	count(part_cat_id) %>%
	# Right join part_categories
	right_join(part_categories, by = c("part_cat_id" = "id"))

parts %>%
	count(part_cat_id) %>%
	right_join(part_categories, by = c("part_cat_id" = "id")) %>%
	# Filter for NA
	filter(is.na(n))
```

Great! From this filter, you found an instance where a part category is present in one table, but missing from the other table. It's important to understand which entries would be impacted by `replace_na(`), so that we know which entries we would be omitting by using that function.

**Cleaning up your count**

In both left and right joins, there is the opportunity for there to be NA values in the resulting table. Fortunately, the `replace_na` function can turn those NAs into meaningful values.

In the last exercise, we saw that the `n` column had NAs after the `right_join`. Let's use the `replace_na` column, which takes a `list` of column names and the values with which NAs should be replaced, to clean up our table.

```{r}
library(tidyr)

parts %>%
	count(part_cat_id) %>%
	right_join(part_categories, by = c("part_cat_id" = "id")) %>%
	# Use replace_na to replace missing values in the n column
	replace_na(list(n = 0))
```

Awesome! Now you have replaced NAs with 0s for your analysis.

## Joining tables to themselves

**Joining themes to their children**

Tables can be joined to themselves!

In the `themes` table, which is available for you to inspect in the console, you'll notice there is both an `id` column and a `parent_id` column. Keeping that in mind, you can join the `themes` table to itself to determine the parent-child relationships that exist for different themes.

In the videos, you saw themes joined to their own parents. In this exercise, you'll try a similar approach of joining themes to their own *children*, which is similar but reversed. Let's try this out to discover what children the theme `"Harry Potter"` has.

```{r}
themes <- readRDS("_data/themes.rds")
themes

themes %>% 
	# Inner join the themes table
	inner_join(themes, by = c("id" = "parent_id"), suffix = c("_parent", "_child")) %>% 
	# Filter for the "Harry Potter" parent name 
	filter(name_parent == "Harry Potter")
```

Great! It looks like the Harry Potter parent theme has a few children, which are named after the books and movies from the series.

**Joining themes to their grandchildren**

We can go a step further than looking at themes and their children. Some themes actually have *grandchildren*: their children's children.

Here, we can inner join `themes` to a filtered version of itself `again` to establish a connection between our last join's children and `their` children.

```{r}
# Join themes to itself again to find the grandchild relationships
themes %>% 
  inner_join(themes, by = c("id" = "parent_id"), suffix = c("_parent", "_child")) %>%
  inner_join(themes, by = c("id_child" = "parent_id"), suffix = c("_parent", "_grandchild"))
```

Awesome! It looks like there are 158 grandparent-grandchild relationships of LEGO themes. Now you're a whiz at using self joins to learn about hierarchical relationships.

**Left-joining a table to itself**

So far, you've been inner joining a table to itself in order to find the children of themes like `"Harry Potter"` or `"The Lord of the Rings"`.

But some themes might not have any children at all, which means they won't be included in the inner join. As you've learned in this chapter, you can identify those with a `left_join` and a `filter()`.

```{r}
themes %>% 
  # Left join the themes table to its own children
  left_join(themes, by = c("id" = "parent_id"), suffix = c("_parent", "_child")) %>%
  # Filter for themes that have no child themes
  filter(is.na(name_child))
```

Wow! From this table, we learned that there are 586 themes in total that do not have any child themes.

## The full_join verb

![](_images/524.png)

**Differences between Batman and Star Wars**

In the video, you compared two sets. Now, you'll compare two themes, each of which is made up of many sets.

First, you'll need to join in the `themes`. Recall that doing so requires going through the `sets` first. You'll use the `inventory_parts_joined` table from the video, which is already available to you in the console.

```
inventory_parts_joined <- inventories %>%
  inner_join(inventory_parts, by = c("id" = "inventory_id")) %>%
  arrange(desc(quantity)) %>%
  select(-id, -version)
```

```{r}
inventory_parts_joined <- inventories %>%
  inner_join(inventory_parts, by = c("id" = "inventory_id")) %>%
  arrange(desc(quantity)) %>%
  select(-id, -version)

# Start with inventory_parts_joined table
inventory_parts_joined %>%
  # Combine with the sets table 
  inner_join(sets, by = "set_num") %>%
  # Combine with the themes table
  inner_join(themes, by = c("theme_id" = "id"), suffix = c("_set", "_theme"))
```

Good work! Since each theme is made up of many sets, combining these tables is the first step towards being able to compare different themes.

**Aggregating each theme**

Previously, you combined tables to compare themes. Before doing this comparison, you'll want to aggregate the data to learn more about the pieces that are a part of each theme, as well as the colors of those pieces.

The table you created previously has been preloaded for you as `inventory_sets_themes`. It was filtered for each theme, and the objects have been saved as `batman` and `star_wars`.

```
inventory_sets_themes <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
  inner_join(sets, by = "set_num") %>%
  inner_join(themes, by = c("theme_id" = "id"), suffix = c("_set", "_theme"))
```
```
batman <- inventory_sets_themes %>%
  filter(name_theme == "Batman")
```
```
star_wars <- inventory_sets_themes %>%
  filter(name_theme == "Star Wars")
```

```{r}
inventory_sets_themes <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
  inner_join(sets, by = "set_num") %>%
  inner_join(themes, by = c("theme_id" = "id"), suffix = c("_set", "_theme"))
inventory_sets_themes

batman <- inventory_sets_themes %>%
  filter(name_theme == "Batman")
batman

star_wars <- inventory_sets_themes %>%
  filter(name_theme == "Star Wars")
star_wars

# Count the part number and color id, weight by quantity
batman %>%
  count(part_num, color_id, wt = quantity)
star_wars %>%
  count(part_num, color_id, wt = quantity)
```

Great aggregating! Now that your information about the pieces in each of these themes is more organized, you are closer to being able to compare them to learn more about the similarities and differences between these themes!

**Full-joining Batman and Star Wars LEGO parts**

Now that you've got separate tables for the pieces in the `batman` and `star_wars` themes, you'll want to be able to combine them to see any similarities or differences between the two themes. The aggregating from the last exercise has been saved as `batman_parts` and `star_wars_parts`, and is preloaded for you.

```
batman_parts <- batman %>%
  count(part_num, color_id, wt = quantity)
```
```
star_wars_parts <- star_wars %>%
  count(part_num, color_id, wt = quantity)
```

```{r}
batman_parts <- batman %>%
  count(part_num, color_id, wt = quantity)

star_wars_parts <- star_wars %>%
  count(part_num, color_id, wt = quantity)

batman_parts %>%
  # Combine the star_wars_parts table 
  full_join(star_wars_parts, by = c("part_num", "color_id"), suffix = c("_batman", "_star_wars")) %>%
  # Replace NAs with 0s in the n_batman and n_star_wars columns 
  replace_na(list(n_batman = 0, n_star_wars = 0))
```

Awesome! Now, you've created a comprehensive table that includes the part number, color id, and quantity of each piece in the Batman and Star Wars themes!

**Comparing Batman and Star Wars LEGO parts**

The table you created in the last exercise includes the part number of each piece, the color id, and the number of each piece in the Star Wars and Batman themes. However, we have more information about each of these parts that we can gain by combining this table with some of the information we have in other tables. Before we compare the themes, let's ensure that we have enough information to make our findings more interpretable. The table from the last exercise has been saved as `parts_joined` and is preloaded for you.

```
parts_joined <- batman_parts %>%
  full_join(star_wars_parts, by = c("part_num", "color_id"), suffix = c("_batman", "_star_wars")) %>%
  replace_na(list(n_batman = 0, n_star_wars = 0))
```

```{r}
parts_joined <- batman_parts %>%
  full_join(star_wars_parts, by = c("part_num", "color_id"), suffix = c("_batman", "_star_wars")) %>%
  replace_na(list(n_batman = 0, n_star_wars = 0))

parts_joined %>%
  # Sort the number of star wars pieces in descending order 
  arrange(desc(n_star_wars)) %>%
  # Join the colors table to the parts_joined table
  inner_join(colors, by = c("color_id" = "id")) %>%
  # Join the parts table to the previous join 
  inner_join(parts, by = "part_num", suffix = c("_color", "_part"))
```

You can now see the pieces side by side from each of these themes. Since the pieces are sorted by number of Star Wars pieces in descending order, you can see that the most common Star Wars piece is Black and has the part number `2780`. While there are 392 pieces of this part in the Star Wars theme, you can also see from the table that there are 104 pieces of the same part in the Batman theme. Well done!

## The semi- and anti-join verbs

 **Mutating verbs**
 
 - `inner_join`
 - `left_join`
 - `right_join`
 - `full_join`
 
 **Filtering joins**
 
 - Keeps or removes observations from the first table
 - Doesn't add new variables
 - `semi_join()`
 - `anti_join()`

**Something within one set but not another**

In the videos, you learned how to filter using the semi- and anti-join verbs to answer questions you have about your data. Let's focus on the `batwing` dataset, and use our skills to determine which parts are in both the `batwing` and `batmobile` sets, and which sets are in one, but not the other. While answering these questions, we'll also be determining whether or not the parts we're looking at in both sets also have the same color in common.

The `batmobile` and `batwing` datasets have been preloaded for you.

```
batmobile <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
  filter(set_num == "7784-1") %>%
  select(-set_num)
```
```
batwing <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
  filter(set_num == "70916-1") %>%
  select(-set_num)
```

```{r}
batmobile <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
  filter(set_num == "7784-1") %>%
  select(-set_num)

batwing <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
  filter(set_num == "70916-1") %>%
  select(-set_num)

# Filter the batwing set for parts that are also in the batmobile set
batwing %>%
  semi_join(batmobile, by = c("part_num"))

# Filter the batwing set for parts that aren't in the batmobile set
batwing %>%
  anti_join(batmobile, by = c("part_num"))
```

Good work! Based on these joins, we now know that there are 126 parts in the batwing set that are also in the batmobile set, and 183 parts that are in the batwing set that aren't in the batmobile set.

**What colors are included in at least one set?**

Besides comparing two sets directly, you could also use a filtering join like `semi_join` to find out which colors ever appear in any inventory part. Some of the colors could be optional, meaning they aren't included in any sets.

The `inventory_parts` and `colors` tables have been preloaded for you.

```{r}
# Use inventory_parts to find colors included in at least one set
colors %>%
  semi_join(inventory_parts, by = c("id" = "color_id")) 
```

Wow! Out of the 179 colors in the `colors` table, there are 134 colors that are included in at least one set.

**Which set is missing version 1?**

Each set included in the LEGO data has an associated version number. We want to understand the version we are looking at to learn more about the parts that are included. Before doing that, we should confirm that there aren't any sets that are missing a particular version.

Let's start by looking at the first version of each set to see if there are any sets that don't include a first version.

```{r}
# Use filter() to extract version 1 
version_1_inventories <- inventories %>%
  filter(version == 1)

# Use anti_join() to find which set is missing a version 1
sets %>%
  anti_join(version_1_inventories, by = "set_num")
```

Good work! This is likely a data quality issue, and anti_join is a great tool for finding problems like that.

## Visualizing set differences

![](_images/527.png)

**Aggregating sets to look at their differences**

To compare two individual sets, and the kinds of LEGO pieces that comprise them, we'll need to aggregate the data into separate themes. Additionally, as we saw in the video, we'll want to add a column so that we can understand the percentages of specific pieces that are part of each set, rather than looking at the numbers of pieces alone.

The `inventory_parts_themes` table has been preloaded for you.

```
inventory_parts_themes <- inventories %>%
  inner_join(inventory_parts, by = c("id" = "inventory_id")) %>%
  arrange(desc(quantity)) %>%
  select(-id, -version) %>%
  inner_join(sets, by = "set_num") %>%
  inner_join(themes, by = c("theme_id" = "id"), suffix 
```

```{r}
inventory_parts_themes <- inventories %>%
  inner_join(inventory_parts, by = c("id" = "inventory_id")) %>%
  arrange(desc(quantity)) %>%
  select(-id, -version) %>%
  inner_join(sets, by = "set_num") %>%
  inner_join(themes, by = c("theme_id" = "id"), suffix = c("_set", "_theme"))
inventory_parts_themes

batman_colors <- inventory_parts_themes %>%
  # Filter the inventory_parts_themes table for the Batman theme
  filter(name_theme == "Batman") %>%
  group_by(color_id) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(quantity)) %>%
  # Add a percent column of the total divided by the sum of the total 
  mutate(percent = total / sum(total))
batman_colors

# Filter and aggregate the Star Wars set data; add a percent column
star_wars_colors <- inventory_parts_themes %>%
  filter(name_theme == "Star Wars") %>%
  group_by(color_id) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(quantity)) %>%
  mutate(percent = total / sum(total))
star_wars_colors
```

Good work! In addition to being able to view the sets for Batman and Star Wars separately, adding the colum also allowed us to be able to look at the percentage differences between the sets, rather than only being able to compare the numbers of pieces. This will become more useful as we more forward in our analysis.

**Combining sets**

The data you aggregated in the last exercise has been preloaded for you as `batman_colors` and `star_wars_colors`. Prior to visualizing the data, you'll want to combine these tables to be able to directly compare the themes' colors.

```
batman_colors <- inventory_parts_themes %>%
  filter(name_theme == "Batman") %>%
  group_by(color_id) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(quantity)) %>%
  mutate(percent = total / sum(total))
```
```
star_wars_colors <- inventory_parts_themes %>%
  filter(name_theme == "Star Wars") %>%
  group_by(color_id) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(quantity)) %>%
  mutate(percent = total / sum(total))
```

```{r}
batman_colors <- inventory_parts_themes %>%
  filter(name_theme == "Batman") %>%
  group_by(color_id) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(quantity)) %>%
  mutate(percent = total / sum(total))

star_wars_colors <- inventory_parts_themes %>%
  filter(name_theme == "Star Wars") %>%
  group_by(color_id) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(quantity)) %>%
  mutate(percent = total / sum(total))

batman_colors %>%
  # Join the Batman and Star Wars colors
  full_join(star_wars_colors, by = "color_id", suffix = c("_batman", "_star_wars")) %>%
  # Replace NAs in the total_batman and total_star_wars columns
  replace_na(list(total_batman = 0, total_star_wars = 0)) %>%
  inner_join(colors, by = c("color_id" = "id"))

batman_colors %>%
  full_join(star_wars_colors, by = "color_id", suffix = c("_batman", "_star_wars")) %>%
  replace_na(list(total_batman = 0, total_star_wars = 0)) %>%
  inner_join(colors, by = c("color_id" = "id")) %>%
  # Create the difference and total columns
  mutate(difference = percent_batman - percent_star_wars,
         total = total_batman + total_star_wars) %>%
  # Filter for totals greater than 200
  filter(total >= 200)
```

Nice work! With this combined table that contains all the information from the `batman_colors` and `star_wars_colors` tables, you can now create an informative visualization to compare the colors of these sets.

**Visualizing the difference: Batman and Star Wars**

In the last exercise, you created `colors_joined`. Now you'll create a bar plot with one bar for each color (`name`), showing the difference in percentages.

Because factors and visualization are beyond the scope of this course, we've done some processing for you: here is the code that created the `colors_joined` table that will be used in the video.

```
colors_joined <- batman_colors %>%
  full_join(star_wars_colors, by = "color_id", suffix = c("_batman", "_star_wars")) %>%
  replace_na(list(total_batman = 0, total_star_wars = 0)) %>%
  inner_join(colors, by = c("color_id" = "id")) %>%
  mutate(difference = percent_batman - percent_star_wars,
         total = total_batman + total_star_wars) %>%
  filter(total >= 200) %>%
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, difference)) 
```

```{r}
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)

colors_joined <- batman_colors %>%
  full_join(star_wars_colors, by = "color_id", suffix = c("_batman", "_star_wars")) %>%
  replace_na(list(total_batman = 0, total_star_wars = 0)) %>%
  inner_join(colors, by = c("color_id" = "id")) %>%
  mutate(difference = percent_batman - percent_star_wars,
         total = total_batman + total_star_wars) %>%
  filter(total >= 200) %>%
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, difference)) %>%
  drop_na()
colors_joined

# Create a bar plot using colors_joined and the name and difference columns
color_palette <- setNames(colors_joined$rgb, colors_joined$name)

ggplot(colors_joined, aes(name, difference, fill = name)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = color_palette, guide = FALSE) +
  labs(y = "Difference: Batman - Star Wars")
```

Great! As you can see from the plot, the Batman set has more black, yellow, and red, while the Star Wars set has more light bluish gray, white, and tan.

## Stack Overflow questions

![](_images/528.png)

**Left-joining questions and tags**

Three of the Stack Overflow survey datasets are `questions`, `question_tags`, and `tags`:

- `questions`: an ID and the score, or how many times the question has been upvoted; the data only includes R-based questions
- `question_tags`: a tag ID for each question and the question's id
- `tags`: a tag id and the tag's name, which can be used to identify the subject of each question, such as ggplot2 or dplyr

In this exercise, we'll be stitching together these datasets and replacing NAs in important fields.

Note that we'll be using `left_join`s in this exercise to ensure we keep all questions, even those without a corresponding tag. However, since we know the `questions` data is all R data, we'll want to manually tag these as R questions with `replace_na`.

```{r}
questions <- readRDS("_data/questions.rds")
questions
question_tags <- readRDS("_data/question_tags.rds")
question_tags
tags <- readRDS("_data/tags.rds")
tags

# Join the questions and question_tags tables
questions %>%
    left_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id"))

# Join in the tags table
questions %>%
	left_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
	left_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))

# Replace the NAs in the tag_name column
questions %>%
  left_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
  left_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id")) %>%
  replace_na(list(tag_name="only-r"))
```

Awesome! We now have a dataset that we can analyze after all that joining.

**Comparing scores across tags**

The complete dataset you created in the last exercise is available to you as `questions_with_tags`. Let's do a quick bit of analysis on it! You'll use familiar dplyr verbs like `group_by`, `summarize`, `arrange`, and `n` to find out the average score of the most asked questions.

```{r}
questions_with_tags <- questions %>%
  left_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
  left_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id")) %>%
  replace_na(list(tag_name="only-r"))

questions_with_tags %>%
	# Group by tag_name
	group_by(tag_name) %>%
	# Get mean score and num_questions
	summarize(score = mean(score),
          	  num_questions = n()) %>%
	# Sort num_questions in descending order
	arrange(desc(num_questions))
```

Nice! It looks like questions with the R tag get a relatively low score, but questions with the loops tag are even lower.

**What tags never appear on R questions?**

The `tags` table includes all Stack Overflow tags, but some have nothing to do with` R`. How could you filter for just the tags that never appear on an R question? The `tags` and `question_tags` tables have been preloaded for you.

```{r}
# Using a join, filter for tags that are never on an R question
tags %>%
  anti_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "tag_id"))
```

Great! It looks like there are more than 40,000 tags that have never appeared along R!

## Joining questions and answers

**Finding gaps between questions and answers**

Now we'll join together `questions` with `answers` so we can measure the time between questions and answers.

Make sure to explore the tables and columns in the console before starting the exercise. Can you tell how are questions identified in the `questions` table? How can you identify which answer corresponds to which question using the `answers` table?

```{r}
answers <- readRDS("_data/answers.rds")

questions %>%
	# Inner join questions and answers with proper suffixes
	inner_join(answers, by = c("id" = "question_id"), suffix = c("_question", "_answer")) %>%
	# Subtract creation_date_question from creation_date_answer to create gap
	mutate(gap = as.integer(creation_date_answer - creation_date_question)) 
```

Nice! Now we could use this information to identify how long it takes different questions to get answers.

**Joining question and answer counts**

We can also determine how many questions actually yield answers. If we count the number of answers for each question, we can then join the answers counts with the `questions` table.

```{r}
# Count and sort the question id column in the answers table
answer_counts <- answers %>%
	count(question_id, sort = TRUE)
answer_counts

# Combine the answer_counts and questions tables
questions %>%
	left_join(answer_counts, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
	# Replace the NAs in the n column
	replace_na(list(n = 0))
```

Great! You can use this combined table to see which questions have the most answers, and which questions have no answers.

**Joining questions, answers, and tags**

Let's build on the last exercise by adding the `tags` table to our previous joins. This will allow us to do a better job of identifying which R topics get the most traction on Stack Overflow. The tables you created in the last exercise have been preloaded for you as `answer_counts` and `question_answer_counts`.

```
answer_counts <- answers %>%
    count(question_id, sort = TRUE)

question_answer_counts <- questions %>%
    left_join(answer_counts, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
    replace_na(list(n = 0))
```

```{r}
answer_counts <- answers %>%
    count(question_id, sort = TRUE)

question_answer_counts <- questions %>%
    left_join(answer_counts, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
    replace_na(list(n = 0))

question_answer_counts %>%
	# Join the question_tags tables
	inner_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
	# Join the tags table
	inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))
```

Great! Now we have a more holistic view of how questions are answered by each tag.

**Average answers by question**

The table you created in the last exercise has been preloaded for you as `tagged_answers`. You can use this table to determine, on average, how many answers each questions gets.

```
tagged_answers <- question_answer_counts %>%
    inner_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
    inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))
```

Some of the important variables from this table include: `n`, the number of answers for each question, and `tag_name`, the name of each tag associated with each question.

Let's use some of our favorite dplyr verbs to find out how many answers each question gets on average.

```{r}
tagged_answers <- question_answer_counts %>%
    inner_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
    inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))

tagged_answers %>%
	# Aggregate by tag_name
    group_by(tag_name) %>%
	# Summarize questions and average_answers
    summarize(questions = n(),
              average_answers = mean(n)) %>%
	# Sort the questions in descending order
    arrange(desc(questions))
```

Great! You can see if you post a question about ggplot2, on average you'll get an answer.

**Joining questions and answers with tags**

To learn more about the `questions` and `answers` table, you'll want to use the `question_tags` table to understand the tags associated with each question that was asked, and each answer that was provided. You'll be able to combine these tables using two inner joins on both the `questions` table and the `answers` table.

```{r}
# Inner join the question_tags and tags tables with the questions table
questions %>%
  inner_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
  inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))

# Inner join the question_tags and tags tables with the answers table
answers %>%
  inner_join(question_tags, by = "question_id") %>%
  inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))
```

Great! Now we will be able to combine each of these individual tables into a single cohesive table to have a better understanding of the information we have about the questions, answers, and associated tags.

**Binding and counting posts with tags**

The tables you created in the previous exercise have been preloaded as `questions_with_tags` and `answers_with_tags`. First, you'll want to combine these tables into a single table called `posts_with_tags`. Once the information is consolidated into a single table, you can add more information by creating a date variable using the `lubridate` package, which has been preloaded for you.

```
questions_with_tags <- questions %>%
  inner_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
  inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))
```
```
answers_with_tags <- answers %>%
  inner_join(question_tags, by = "question_id") %>%
  inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))
```

```{r}
library(lubridate)

questions_with_tags <- questions %>%
  inner_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
  inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))

answers_with_tags <- answers %>%
  inner_join(question_tags, by = "question_id") %>%
  inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))

# Combine the two tables into posts_with_tags
posts_with_tags <- bind_rows(questions_with_tags %>% mutate(type = "question"),
                              answers_with_tags %>% mutate(type = "answer"))

# Add a year column, then aggregate by type, year, and tag_name
posts_with_tags %>%
  mutate(year = year(creation_date)) %>%
  count(type, year, tag_name)
```

Great work! Now you have a single table that displays the `type`, `year`, `tag_name`, and count as `n`.

**Visualizing questions and answers in tags**

In the last exercise, you modified the `posts_with_tags` table to add a `year` column, and aggregated by `type`, `year`, and `tag_name`. The modified table has been preloaded for you as `by_type_year_tag`, and has one observation for each type (question/answer), year, and tag. Let's create a plot to examine the information that the table contains about questions and answers for the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` tags. The `ggplot2` package has been preloaded for you.

```
by_type_year_tag <- posts_with_tags %>%
  mutate(year = year(creation_date)) %>%
  count(type, year, tag_name)
```

```{r}
by_type_year_tag <- posts_with_tags %>%
  mutate(year = year(creation_date)) %>%
  count(type, year, tag_name)

# Filter for the dplyr and ggplot2 tag names 
by_type_year_tag_filtered <- by_type_year_tag %>%
  filter(tag_name %in% c("dplyr", "ggplot2"))

# Create a line plot faceted by the tag name 
ggplot(by_type_year_tag_filtered, aes(year, n, color = type)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ tag_name)
```

Neat! Notice answers on dplyr questions are growing faster than dplyr questions themselves; meaning the average dplyr question has more answers than the average ggplot2 question.
