## Why you should use functions

**The arguments to mean()**

Mean has 3 arguments

- `x`: a numeric or date-time vector
- `trim`: the proportion of outliers from each end to remove before calculating
- `na.rm`: remove before calculating

**Calling mean()**

Pass arguments by position

`mean(numbers, 0.1, TRUE)`

Pass arguments by name

`mean(na.rm = TRUE, trim = 0.1, x = numbers)`

Common arguments by position, rare arguments by name

`mean(numbers, trim = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE)`

**Benefits of writing functions**

Functions eliminate repetition from your code, which

- can reduce your workload, and
- help avoid errors

Functions also allow code reuse and sharing

**Calling functions**

One way to make your code more readable is to be careful about the order you pass arguments when you call functions, and whether you pass the arguments by position or by name.

`gold_medals`, a numeric vector of the number of gold medals won by each country in the 2016 Summer Olympics, is provided.

For convenience, the arguments of [median()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/topics/median) and [rank()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/rank) are displayed using `args()`. Setting `rank()`'s `na.last` argument to `"keep"` means "keep the rank of NA values as NA".

Best practice for calling functions is to include them in the order shown by `args()`, and to only name rare arguments.

**Arguments of sample()**

- `x`: a vector of values to sample from
- `size`: how many times do you want to sample from `x`?
- `replace`: should you sample with replacement or not?
- `prob`: a vector of sampling weights for each value of `x`, totalling one.

**Your first function: tossing a coin**

Time to write your first function! It's a really good idea when writing functions to start simple. You can always make a function more complicated later if it's really necessary, so let's not worry about arguments for now.

```{r}
coin_sides <- c("head", "tail")

# Sample from coin_sides once
sample(coin_sides, 1)

# Write a template for your function, toss_coin()
toss_coin <- function() {
  # (Leave the contents of the body for later)
# Add punctuation to finish the body
}

# Paste your script into the function body
toss_coin <- function() {
  coin_sides <- c("head", "tail")
sample(coin_sides, 1)
}

# Call your function
toss_coin()
```

Fantastic function writing! Since there were no arguments to worry about, all you had to do was paste your script inside a function definition template.

**Inputs to functions**

Most functions require some sort of input to determine what to compute. The inputs to functions are called **arguments**. You specify them inside the parentheses after the word "function."

As mentioned in the video, the following exercises assume that you are using [sample()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/sample) to do random sampling.

```{r}
coin_sides <- c("head", "tail")
n_flips <- 10

# Sample from coin_sides n_flips times with replacement
sample(coin_sides, n_flips, replace = TRUE)

# Update the function to return n_flips coin tosses
toss_coin <- function(n_flips) {
  coin_sides <- c("head", "tail")
  sample(coin_sides, n_flips, replace = TRUE)
}

# Generate 10 coin tosses
toss_coin(10)
```

Amazing argument addition! The arguments to a function are specified inside the parentheses on the signature line.

**Multiple inputs to functions**

If a function should have more than one argument, list them in the function signature, separated by commas.

To solve this exercise, you need to know how to specify sampling weights to `sample()`. Set the `prob` argument to a numeric vector with the same length as `x`. Each value of `prob` is the probability of sampling the corresponding element of `x`, so their values add up to one. In the following example, each sample has a 20% chance of `"bat"`, a 30% chance of `"cat"` and a 50% chance of `"rat"`.

```
sample(c("bat", "cat", "rat"), 10, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.3, 0.5))
```

```{r}
coin_sides <- c("head", "tail")
n_flips <- 10
p_head <- 0.8

# Define a vector of weights
weights <- c(p_head, 1 - p_head)

# Update so that heads are sampled with prob p_head
sample(coin_sides, n_flips, replace = TRUE, prob = weights)

# Update the function so heads have probability p_head
toss_coin <- function(n_flips, p_head) {
  coin_sides <- c("head", "tail")
  # Define a vector of weights
  weights <- c(p_head, 1 - p_head)
  # Modify the sampling to be weighted
  sample(coin_sides, n_flips, replace = TRUE, prob = weights)
}

# Generate 10 coin tosses
toss_coin(10, .80)
```

Magnificent multiple-argument specification! When you have multiple arguments in the function signature, their names are separated by commas.

## Y kant I reed ur code?

**dplyr verbs()**

- `select()` *selects* columns
- `filter()` *filters* rows

**Function names should contain a verb**

- get
- calculate (or maybe just calc)
- run
- process
- import
- clean
- tidy
- draw

**lm() is badly named**

- acronymns aren't self-explanatory
- it doesn't contain a verb
- there are lots of different linear models

A better name would be `run_linear_regression()`

**Readability vs. typeability**
- understanding code >> typing code
- code editors have autocomplete
- you can alias common functions

**Arguments of lm()**

```

**Renaming GLM**

R's generalized linear regression function, `glm()`, suffers the same usability problems as `lm()`: its name is an acronym, and its `formula` and `data` arguments are in the wrong order.

To solve this exercise, you need to know two things about generalized linear regression:

1. `glm()` formulas are specified like `lm()` formulas: response is on the left, and explanatory variables are added on the right.
2. To model count data, set `glm()`'s `family` argument to `poisson`, making it a Poisson regression.

Here you'll use data on the [number of yearly visits to Snake River](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/COUNT/topics/loomis) at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, `snake_river_visits`.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
snake_river_visits <- readRDS("_data/snake_river_visits.rds")

# Run a generalized linear regression 
glm(
  # Model no. of visits vs. gender, income, travel
  n_visits ~ gender + income + travel, 
  # Use the snake_river_visits dataset
  data = snake_river_visits, 
  # Make it a Poisson regression
  family = poisson
)

# Write a function to run a Poisson regression
run_poisson_regression <- function(data, formula) {
    glm(formula, data, family = poisson)
}

# Re-run the Poisson regression, using your function
model <- snake_river_visits %>%
  run_poisson_regression(n_visits ~ gender + income + travel)
```
```
# Run this to see the predictions
snake_river_explanatory %>%
  mutate(predicted_n_visits = predict(model, ., type = "response"))%>%
  arrange(desc(predicted_n_visits))
```
```

**Numeric defaults**

`cut_by_quantile()` converts a numeric vector into a categorical variable where quantiles define the cut points. This is a useful function, but at the moment you have to specify five arguments to make it work. This is too much thinking and typing.

By specifying default arguments, you can make it easier to use. Let's start with `n`, which specifies how many categories to cut `x` into.

A numeric vector of the number of visits to Snake River is provided as `n_visits`.

```{r}
n_visits <- snake_river_visits$n_visits

# Set the default for n to 5
cut_by_quantile <- function(x, n = 5, na.rm, labels, interval_type) {
  probs <- seq(0, 1, length.out = n + 1)
  qtiles <- quantile(x, probs, na.rm = na.rm, names = FALSE)
  right <- switch(interval_type, "(lo, hi]" = TRUE, "[lo, hi)" = FALSE)
  cut(x, qtiles, labels = labels, right = right, include.lowest = TRUE)
}

# Remove the n argument from the call
cut_by_quantile(
  n_visits,
  na.rm = FALSE, 
  labels = c("very low", "low", "medium", "high", "very high"),
  interval_type = "(lo, hi]"
)
```

Nice numeric default setting! Remember to only set defaults for numeric *detail* arguments, not *data* arguments.

**Logical defaults**

`cut_by_quantile()` is now slightly easier to use, but you still always have to specify the `na.rm` argument. This removes missing values – it behaves the same as the `na.rm` argument to `mean()` or `sd()`.

Where functions have an argument for removing missing values, the best practice is to not remove them by default (in case you hadn't spotted that you had missing values). That means that the default for `na.rm` should be `FALSE`.

```{r}
# Set the default for na.rm to FALSE
cut_by_quantile <- function(x, n = 5, na.rm = FALSE, labels, interval_type) {
  probs <- seq(0, 1, length.out = n + 1)
  qtiles <- quantile(x, probs, na.rm = na.rm, names = FALSE)
  right <- switch(interval_type, "(lo, hi]" = TRUE, "[lo, hi)" = FALSE)
  cut(x, qtiles, labels = labels, right = right, include.lowest = TRUE)
}

# Remove the na.rm argument from the call
cut_by_quantile(
  n_visits,
  labels = c("very low", "low", "medium", "high", "very high"),
  interval_type = "(lo, hi]"
)
```

Lovely logical default setting! For most variable types, you can just set a default using `arg = default_value` in the function signature.

**NULL defaults**

The `cut()` function used by `cut_by_quantile()` can automatically provide sensible labels for each category. The code to generate these labels is [pretty complicated](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/29a9e663a2352843a6ea26b259725b0b97d0e4bd/src/library/base/R/cut.R#L42-L60), so rather than appearing in the function signature directly, its `labels` argument defaults to `NULL`, and the calculation details are shown on the [?cut](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/cut) help page.

```{r}
# Set the default for labels to NULL
cut_by_quantile <- function(x, n = 5, na.rm = FALSE, labels = NULL, interval_type) {
  probs <- seq(0, 1, length.out = n + 1)
  qtiles <- quantile(x, probs, na.rm = na.rm, names = FALSE)
  right <- switch(interval_type, "(lo, hi]" = TRUE, "[lo, hi)" = FALSE)
  cut(x, qtiles, labels = labels, right = right, include.lowest = TRUE)
}

# Remove the labels argument from the call
cut_by_quantile(
  n_visits,
  interval_type = "(lo, hi]"
)
```

Neat `NULL` default setting! If you use this capability, make sure to document how the argument behaves in the function's help page.

**Categorical defaults**

When cutting up a numeric vector, you need to worry about what happens if a value lands exactly on a boundary. You can either put this value into a category of the lower interval or the higher interval. That is, you can choose your intervals to include values at the top boundary but not the bottom (in mathematical terminology, "open on the left, closed on the right", or `(lo, hi]`). Or you can choose the opposite ("closed on the left, open on the right", or `[lo, hi)`). `cut_by_quantile()` should allow these two choices.

The pattern for categorical defaults is:

```
function(cat_arg = c("choice1", "choice2")) {
  cat_arg <- match.arg(cat_arg)
}
```

**Free hint:** In the console, type `head(rank)` to see the start of `rank()`'s definition, and look at the `ties.method` argument.

```{r}
# Set the categories for interval_type to "(lo, hi]" and "[lo, hi)"
cut_by_quantile <- function(x, n = 5, na.rm = FALSE, labels = NULL, 
                            interval_type = c("(lo, hi]", "[lo, hi)")) {
  # Match the interval_type argument
  interval_type <- match.arg(interval_type)
  probs <- seq(0, 1, length.out = n + 1)
  qtiles <- quantile(x, probs, na.rm = na.rm, names = FALSE)
  right <- switch(interval_type, "(lo, hi]" = TRUE, "[lo, hi)" = FALSE)
  cut(x, qtiles, labels = labels, right = right, include.lowest = TRUE)
}

# Remove the interval_type argument from the call
cut_by_quantile(n_visits)
```

Clever categorical default setting! As a bonus, `match.arg()` handles throwing an error if the user types a value that wasn't specified.

**Harmonic mean**

The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocal of the data. That is

$harmonic\ mean(x) = 1/arithmetic\ mean(1/x)$

The harmonic mean is often used to average ratio data. You'll be using it on the price/earnings ratio of stocks in the Standard and Poor's 500 index, provided as `std_and_poor500`. Price/earnings ratio is a measure of how expensive a stock is.

The `dplyr` package is loaded.

```{r}
std_and_poor500 <- readRDS("_data/std_and_poor500_with_pe_2019-06-21.rds")

# Look at the Standard and Poor 500 data
glimpse(std_and_poor500)

# Write a function to calculate the reciprocal
get_reciprocal <- function(x) {
  1/x
}

# Write a function to calculate the harmonic mean
calc_harmonic_mean <- function(x) {
  x %>%
    get_reciprocal() %>%
    mean() %>%
    get_reciprocal()
}

std_and_poor500 %>% 
  # Group by sector
  group_by(sector) %>% 
  # Summarize, calculating harmonic mean of P/E ratio
  summarize(hmean_pe_ratio = calc_harmonic_mean(pe_ratio))
```

Happy harmonizing! It looks like we have a problem though: most sectors have missing values.

**Dealing with missing values**

In the last exercise, many sectors had an `NA` value for the harmonic mean. It would be useful for your function to be able to remove missing values before calculating.

Rather than writing your own code for this, you can outsource this functionality to `mean()`.

The `dplyr` package is loaded.

```{r}
# Add an na.rm arg with a default, and pass it to mean()
calc_harmonic_mean <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE) {
  x %>%
    get_reciprocal() %>%
    mean(na.rm = na.rm) %>%
    get_reciprocal()
}

std_and_poor500 %>% 
  # Group by sector
  group_by(sector) %>% 
  # Summarize, calculating harmonic mean of P/E ratio
  summarize(hmean_pe_ratio = calc_harmonic_mean(pe_ratio, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Marvelous missing value removal! Using this metric, Real Estate is by far the most expensive sector.

**Passing arguments with ...**

Rather than explicitly giving `calc_harmonic_mean()` and `na.rm` argument, you can use `...` to simply "pass other arguments" to `mean()`.

The `dplyr` package is loaded.

```{r}
# Swap na.rm arg for ... in signature and body
calc_harmonic_mean <- function(x, ...) {
  x %>%
    get_reciprocal() %>%
    mean(...) %>%
    get_reciprocal()
}

std_and_poor500 %>% 
  # Group by sector
  group_by(sector) %>% 
  # Summarize, calculating harmonic mean of P/E ratio
  summarize(hmean_pe_ratio = calc_harmonic_mean(pe_ratio, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Delightful use of dots! Did you notice that this code was the same as in the previous exercise? Using `...` doesn't change how people use your function; it just means the function is more flexible. Whether flexible means better (or not) is up to you to decide.

**Throwing errors with bad arguments**

If a user provides a bad input to a function, the best course of action is to throw an error letting them know. The two rules are

1. Throw the error message as soon as you realize there is a problem (typically at the start of the function).
2. Make the error message easily understandable.

You can use the `assert_*()` functions from `assertive` to check inputs and throw errors when they fail.

```{r}
library(assertive)

calc_harmonic_mean <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE) {
  # Assert that x is numeric

Amazing assertions! Providing human-readable error messages is important when your users are humans!

**Custom error logic**

Sometimes the `assert_*()` functions in `assertive` don't give the most informative error message. For example, the assertions that check if a number is in a numeric range will tell the user that a value is out of range, but then won't say why that's a problem. In that case, you can use the `is_*()` functions in conjunction with messages, warnings, or errors to define custom feedback.

The harmonic mean only makes sense when `x` has all positive values. (Try calculating the harmonic mean of one and minus one to see why.) Make sure your users know this!

```{r}
calc_harmonic_mean <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE) {
  assert_is_numeric(x)
  # Check if any values of x are non-positive
  if(any(is_non_positive(x), na.rm = TRUE)) {
    # Throw an error
    stop("x contains non-positive values, so the harmonic mean makes no sense.")
  }
  x %>%
    get_reciprocal() %>%
    mean(na.rm = na.rm) %>%
    get_reciprocal()
}

# See what happens when you pass it negative numbers
calc_harmonic_mean(std_and_poor500$pe_ratio - 20)
```

Cool custom logic! Explaining what went wrong is helpful to users. Explaining why it is wrong is even better!

**Fixing function arguments**

The harmonic mean function is almost complete. However, you still need to provide some checks on the `na.rm` argument. This time, rather than throwing errors when the input is in an incorrect form, you are going to try to fix it.

`na.rm` should be a logical vector with one element (that is, `TRUE`, or `FALSE`).

The `assertive` package is loaded for you.

```{r}
# Update the function definition to fix the na.rm argument
calc_harmonic_mean <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE) {
  assert_is_numeric(x)
  if(any(is_non_positive(x), na.rm = TRUE)) {
    stop("x contains non-positive values, so the harmonic mean makes no sense.")
  }
  # Use the first value of na.rm, and coerce to logical
  na.rm <- coerce_to(use_first(na.rm), target_class = "logical")
  x %>%
    get_reciprocal() %>%
    mean(na.rm = na.rm) %>%
    get_reciprocal()
}

# See what happens when you pass it malformed na.rm
calc_harmonic_mean(std_and_poor500$pe_ratio, na.rm = 1:5)
```

Considerate argument correction! For small problems with inputs, it can be better to fix things rather than throwing an error.
