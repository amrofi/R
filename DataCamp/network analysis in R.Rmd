- Nodes/vertices are connected via edges. a `1` in the adjacency matrix indicates an edge exists between nodes in the matrix

![](_images/357.png)

- each row represents an edge between two individual vertices in each column

![](_images/358.png)

- first number indicates number of vertices (`7`)
- second number indicates number of edges (`7`)
- final row shows all edges in the network

- number and which vertices
  - `V(g)`
- number and which edges
  - `E(g)`
- number of vertices
  - `gorder(g)`
- number of edges
  - `gsize(g)`

**Creating an igraph object**

Here you will learn how to create an `igraph` 'object' from data stored in an edgelist. The data are friendships in a group of students. You will also learn how to make a basic visualization of the network.

Each row of the friends dataframe represents an edge in the network.

```{r creating-an-igraph-object}
friends <- read.csv("_data/friends.csv")

# Load igraph
library(igraph)

# Inspect the first few rows of the dataframe 'friends'
head(friends)

# Convert friends dataframe to a matrix
friends.mat <- as.matrix(friends)

# Convert friends matrix to an igraph object
g <- graph.edgelist(friends.mat, directed = FALSE)

# Make a very basic plot of the network
plot(g)
```

**Counting vertices and edges**

A lot of basic information about a network can be extracted from an `igraph` object. In this exercise you will learn how to count the vertices and edges from a network by applying several functions to the graph object `g`.

Each row of the friends dataframe represents an edge in the network.

```{r counting-vertices-and-edges}
# Subset vertices and edges
V(g)
E(g)

# Count number of edges
gsize(g)

# Count number of vertices
gorder(g)
```

**Network attributes**

![](_images/360.png)

- `attr` indicates that this `igraph` object has attribute `name` defined

![](_images/361.png)

- the most common edge attribute is `weight` between edges, with line thickness indicating weights.

**Node attributes and subsetting**

In this exercise you will learn how to add attributes to vertices in the network and view them.

```{r node-attributes-and-subsetting}
